<h1>New Article</h1>

<!-- when calling form_for, we pass identifying objects for this form
In this case, it's article. This tells form_for helper what the form is to be used for

inside the block of this method, the FormBuilder object - represented by f - is used
to build two labels and two text fields, one each for the title and text of an article.
Finally, a call to submit on the f object will create a submite button for the form.

<%= render 'form' %>

<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>
